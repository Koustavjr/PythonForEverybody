Week 1:

OOP Terminology

A python program is made up of objects cooperating together.
An Object is a bit of self-contained code and data.

Class: a template
method: a defined capability of a class
field or attribute: a bit of data in class
object: instance of a class

Class:

class partyAnimal:
	x=0
	def party(self):
		self.x=self.x+1
		print("so far",self.x)
an=partyAnimal()<---object
an.party()
an.party()
an.party()<---->partyAnimal.party(an)

dir()---> tells us capabilities or methods of newly created class

Constructors and destructors
Code that runs when object is created is called constructor
def_init_(x)<--constructor
def_del_(x)<---destructor

other way: a=partyAnimal()
	   a=42

class partyAnimal:
	x=0
	name=""
	def_init_(self,nam):
		self.name=nam
		print(self.name)
	def party(self):
		self.x=self.x+1
		print(self.x)

Inheritance
The ability to extend a class to create a new class

class footballFan(partyAnimal)<--inhertance

Week 2:

Relational Databases

RD model data by storing rows and columns in tables. The power of the rd lies in its ability to efficiently retrieve data from those tables.

Databases- contain tables
relation- contains tuples or attributes
tuple or row- set of fields that generally represents an object like a music track
attribute or columns- one of many possible elements of data corresponding to the object represented by the row


SQLLITE:

CREATE TABLE USERS(
name VARCHAR(128),
email VARCHAR(128)<--- size 
)

SQL insert
INSERT INTO USERS (name,email) VALUES ("jkl","jkl@email")

SQL delete

DELETE FROM USERS WHERE email="abc@email"

SQL UPDATE

UPDATE USERS SET name="abc" where email="abc@email"

Retriebing records:

SELECT * FROM USERS
|      | 
|      |____all the column 
coloumn

Sorting with order by
SELECT * FROM USERS ORDER BY email

In python

import sqlite3

con = sqlite3.connect('emaildb.sqlite')
cur=con.cursor()

cur.execute()<--- for db operations
conn.commit()<--- for writing data on disk

Primary,    logic and foreign keys

JOIN operation:

it links across several tables as of a select operation

select Album.title,Artist.name from Album join Artist on Album.artist_id=Artist.id
